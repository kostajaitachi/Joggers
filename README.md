# Joggers
Imagine you are jogging and you are bored of the same song playlist. Wouldnâ€™t it be wonderful if you can share your songs with someone else jogging along the same path? Make an application which allows you to do so. Whenever you start a jog, and you want to share a new playlist, select a song and associate that song with that particular lat/long so that it is discoverable by other people.  Also once you have jogged a while and you want to upload a new song to a playlist, select the playlist and a song to share.  This new song will be added to the playlist and  associated with the new lat/long (place at which you started the second song, which is different lat/long than where you started the first song). As you can see, each time you do a new jog from a new place, any song you choose to shear will be associated with that specific lat/long and the particular playlist you have selected. You do not need to code the download functionality but if you do, you will get extra credit.
